# TwitterClone

Hello world,

Good Day.

Second apps. Basically, this apps copy login page on twitter apps. 

New things that I learned
- Navigate. At first was quite hard to learned. But i got the trick and it seems easy now
- Learned how to hide header
- Enchance css skills. Tested on Iphone 13 Pro Max and this apps looked about the same with the real twitter.

Difficulties
- Center the logo, sizing and padding. I need to use borderWith to see the box size. Its taking some time, but this really helps me a lots!

Comments
- I enjoyed building this apps. Easy, clean and minimalist.
